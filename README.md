Challenges faced:

1.Making it look good on all devices

One of the biggest challenges was making sure the website looks nice on phones, tablets, and desktop screens. Sometimes things wouldn’t line up properly or look too squished on smaller screens.

2.Creating a mobile-friendly menu:

Building a navigation menu that works on mobile was tricky. I had to add a hamburger icon and write some JavaScript to show and hide the menu when tapped.

3.Getting images to scale properly:

The large images, like the main banner and article thumbnails, needed to resize correctly on all screen sizes. If not handled properly, they either looked stretched or made the layout break.

4.Using flexbox and grid together:

I used both Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout, and it was a bit confusing at times to get everything to line up and space out properly—especially when switching between desktop and mobile views.

5.Keeping the text easy to read:

On small screens, the text would sometimes look too small or too crowded. I had to adjust font sizes and spacing to keep everything readable and clean.

6.Making it work on all browsers:

What looked good in one browser (like Chrome) sometimes looked off in another (like Safari). I had to keep testing and tweaking to make sure it worked everywhere.

7.Adding the menu button functionality:

Writing the JavaScript to make the mobile menu open and close took some testing. I had to make sure it didn’t interfere with the rest of the layout or cover important content.

8.Staying on schedule:

It took time to design, code, test, and fix everything. Managing all of that without missing anything was a challenge on its own.
